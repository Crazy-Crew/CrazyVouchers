## Fixes:
* Fixed an issue where custom skulls using player names or textures from minecraft-heads.com weren't working
  * `https://textures.minecraft.net/texture/` is no longer needed in the `player` field
  * You can simply put `1ee3126ff2c343da525eef2b93272b9fed36273d0ea08c2616b80009948ad57e` and it should work.

## Changes:
* Starting to remove reliance on NBT-API, It should not impact current configurations.
