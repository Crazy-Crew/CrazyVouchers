<big>**Initial Plugin Setup**</big><br>
CrazyVouchers as first install will come with a set of default files in the `vouchers` and `codes` folder which are to help you figure out how to use the plugin.
You can simply create more vouchers by copying the files or creating new ones than doing `/crazyvouchers reload`

**The ability to customize the entirety of CrazyVouchers**<br>
If you have found something that you would like to be able to customize,<br>
please make a [feature request,](https://github.com/Crazy-Crew/CrazyVouchers/discussions/categories/features) and we'll see about adding it

**Create an infinite amount of voucher codes**<br>
Voucher Codes can be redeemed through a command, you can even <br>apply a limit of how many times a code can be used!

**The ability to use hex colors**<br>
Hex Colors should be usable throughout the entire plugin.<br>
`#000000` is an example of how to use a hex color! You do not need `&`

**Ability to switch between multiple files and mono files for `vouchers` and `codes`**<br>
You can find the toggle in `config.yml` if you prefer one config file for each. This will not migrate it for you.
